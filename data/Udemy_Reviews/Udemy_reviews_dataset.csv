But it lacks in depth of concepts, it barely touches all topic, but no deep dive. 

It would be better, if there are following modules explaining
1.  cost model of databricks
2. what is DBFS ? How it works ?
3. Best practices around platform
4. how automatically deploy, monitor, debug a production application."

I could either spend hours on AWS documentation reading up on them OR just go to the particular section in this course and get educated on it. This course has provided me with the hands-on learning experience which is absolutely important when you're trying to ramp up on AWS either for your job or for the AWS Data Analytics Specialty certification. With that said I have already recommended Durga Gadiraju's course to folks in my network

Data Engineering using AWS Data Analytics Services,2022-06-17 07:52:37,5,"Well I have been following all the courses by Durga sir. But after learning bigdata now I was looking to learn more on cloud side. How things work in cloud in AWS. Some how I came across this course by Durga sir and I immediately went for it. They way Durga sir explains concept is really commendable. I don't have to go here and there googling things.
Although at one point I got stuck at one of the installation process, so I asked for Help and Durga sir by himself came 1 on 1 to resolve my issue. So this is the best thing I have seen. Person is so dedicated to whatever he does. You will not feel as if you have taken a online course for few bucks but rather it will give you a classroom feeling.
I would highly recommend if you are new to aws and looking for hands on to learn and grow"

Pros: 
1. It focused well on the API's part and that is good. That is major portion of the real exam. 
Cons: 
1. Should have better content in architecture part. 
2. Garbage collection related topic is missing. There are couple of questions related to that also in the exam .
3. Should have explained the answers in the practice paper.
4. Should have additional practice papers for practice."

"Data Engineering Essentials using SQL, Python, and PySpark",2022-06-12 10:33:53,2,"The course is too long, and many things are too rambling and out of focus.
- I really hope this course can provide basic knowledge as well as a project on data engineering. But nevertheless n has too much rambling knowledge
- you did very well the sql part also python. But there's really no need to be so detailed
- in hadoop and spark, it's too fast and lacks details
- I've seen videos that are cut and don't follow what you show in the course.
- in the hadoop and spark section you explain very confusingly, most of what you show I can't follow because of the lack of interactivity
- nothing is clear
- chaotic
- I never saw you develop gw02.itversity.com ? m02.itversity.com ?. Where do these come from? It's really messy and disorganized
- I thought that you can make a basic system from input data and output data that can give me a real understanding of what a data engineering project consists of and how the complete steps are performed. It doesn't need to be too advanced, but it needs to create the basics for people to build on."

It is not your fault, it is due the content of this class itself.

I have learned lots from this class and build a solid knowledge about HDFS/HIVE/IMPALA/SQOOP, which I can apply back to my daily work.

it is one of the longest class I have taken so far from Udemy and you need commit solid time to complete this class.

I will highly recommend this class; but you have to be prepared."

I have completed several courses with him like Cloudera Administration, Spark etc. He is very fast and to the point which I personally like very much. Because there are too many technologies to learn in slow pace. Besides you can always pause, make notes and research when you face difficulty on a particular section. Thank you Sir for your efforts to make this comprehensive course. I believe I can finish it within 60 days."

I had tried several other sources for learning AWS data analytics previously but always ended up getting even more confused. The explanation in these videos are very precise, lucid and easy to follow. The best part is I am able to replicate everything for practice that I see in the lectures. I have one suggestion though. Since I have windows OS I tried to replicate the steps for section 10 (pyspark) using cloud9 and constantly ran into out of memory issue. A lecture on dealing with out of memory issues in PySpark on cloud9 will be really helpful."

Durga is perfectly prepared and really knows what he is doing. 5 Stars for that.
But: To me, a non-native english-speaker, it is quite challenging to understand him. 
He is rushing through everything without slowing down after typing in some commands, which leads to unneccessary jumps back in all lectures, just to do, what he is doing, and - I might have mist that - but he never talks about the bigger concept of his course. """"Do I need AWS and GCP?"""""

The first few sections are just set-ups where a student gets overwhelmed by different technologies. I had to stop several times and deep-dive into postgresql, docker and networking before I could continue. It seems like the best prerequisite is to have a CS degree, in which case you probably do not need this course in the first place. The lecturer is certainly good at data engineering but lecturing is not his strong suite. He speaks terribly fast and makes the impression that he just wants to get it over with. It is a pity because the curriculum DOES look interesting. Nevertheless, I am not going to continue this and I regret I missed the deadline for refund."

It is interesting to learn about cloud setup and IPs and ports and firewalls but the reality of most workplaces is that data engineers or analysts will not have access to any of that or be the ones charged with doing the setup. There are specialists that handle that. 
This course should set up a virtual box VM that they distribute with the course so that students can jump right into the subject matter. 
I am into hour 3 now and am still setting up learning about public IP and private IP.
I am incredibly frustrated with this course.
2nd entry - I got this course on sale and I am still asking for my money back.
I have done 35/600 videos and spent close to 3 hours and it is still the setup to begin the training."

Data Engineering using Databricks on AWS and Azure,2021-11-05 12:41:02,5,"Excellent course! But it would be much better having real example of loading data from several sources/ The course gives the beginning knowlrdge of how things are done, but the cherry on top would be the mini-project. E.g. we have two different sources, pushing similar entity to DataLake and we need to join them to build silver layer. It should show how real deals are done with DB. And also this course has toooo much repeats in videos which student should scroll cause he already seen it many times. Such as 'copying files to s3' and so. They easily can be replaced by text, describing what we have done and the result we are expecting to see, and this can be in form of notebook. Also there could be description what to do with *.dbc files attached in main course description. Also i should say that speech transcription frequently differs from teacher saying and what teacher saying sometimes differs from Classic English spoken language due to strong accent, but to the end of the course i get used to it =) Nevertheless the course is Great! Thank you Very Much!"

I have also covered Big Data in SAS so learning Big Data in PySpark is a useful alternative for me.

Only one problem after I made it halfway through the course, the whole course got updated which meant I had to circle back to re-do some chapters and also cover new chapters, prior warning would have been better. For instance if you knew the course was going to be updated soon you could have given a warning that this would be the case, I would then have waited on commencing the course until it was updated. This would have avoided the confusion of updating the course while I was trying to complete it!"

Whenever he speak he  was actually watching his prepared hand note which he has written before then speak continuously. I do not understand that he is racing car on the high way. Is he a good teacher ???  I don't understand how he upload his unusual lecture on Udemy . He does not have any good intension that the student understand his lecture easily. Just he is destroying Udemy platform . I never faced this kind of situations ever also i am just wasting my few times here.

It helps me a lot to get used to with the certification environment and solving the questions with in given time for exam. I passed the exam using this course. The only improvement could be now Cloudera certification comes with 9 question which you can answer with API or SQL . Hence RDD solutions kind of no use now.

     The course covers a lot of content. 
     Lots of things/concepts had been explained in less time.

Minus/Negative points:
     There are so many places where you feel that there is no link between what the trainer said just 5mins ago and in what he is saying now. You basically have to do research for thorough understanding. Which costs a lot of time."

The course recommends using OVH to rent servers, but the costs seem a bit too expensive, it might be cheaper to buy a second-hand server to practice on (such as an HP DL380 G6/7) which could be the cost of a 1-month subscription to OVH).
Looking forward to the other courses."

I would request that when trying to speak from your native language whether it is Hindi, Punjabi or Tamil or even Bengali, that when you utter the words your tongue should press against the middle of the back the two incisors rather than the base. That will remove the tapping and some of the accent that makes it difficult to understand, although not by much."

All topics are very accomplished and you can tell the teacher knows what he is talking about but if he could condense the content in maybe 12 or 15 minutes videos instead of more than 20 I think that would improve the course. For example take Section 13, I really like this section because you can learn as you follow along the exercise. Maybe other sections can implement this strategy. Anyhow, it is great course and I learned what I came to learnt. Thanks to the gadiraju and congrats for the course."

Actually, apart from the course face value of mere 12$, the ROI is way higher than what you can imagine. Suggestion: @Durga- Like you have mentioned in the course, if you could add the databricks CLI part as well that would be great. Thank you for your efforts!"

In 2020, the exam focuses more on spark2. It would be great if teaching materials can be updated on time.

1.Too much of time spent in emphasizing the fact that this course is not meant for basics and people who want to learn more should register into the other basic courses provided by itversity. It's unnecessary to repeat the same thing over and again.
2. The course can be updated with a better datamodel. The one chosen from cloudera is no more available in cloudera site.
3. More details can be provided as to how the internals of databricks cloud is working
4. Not much information provided how we can run mashup of both (scala & sql) or (python & sql) with temp views created on spark and then use them in further processing
5. Not much information provided on how community edition is using hive with DBFS
6. Scheduling of notebooks with parameters not shown

Below topics can be added for us to understand real world scenarios better.
1. How to schedule a job that will consume data from azure data lake and process in databricks and write in datalake
2. How to mount azure blob storage with databricks and use it further"

I could successfully complete this course successfully  and got certificate from Udemy (Congrats to myself :-)) I will be moving on to Pyspark course ie Hadoop and Spark developer  course next. I can relate to teaching from Durga to  the style of my professors at my Engineering College . This style is spoon feeding :-)  with good notes to practice. To sum it up, this course is not only good for Certifications but also for  learning HDFS,Hive,Impala,Sqoop in detail ."

Apart from the main content, I like the suggestions given by the trainer like how can we improve the performance, efficiency, setting up the executors and its memory, etc. It seems that this course is made by combining videos from multiple sources which have made some of the content repetitive. The trainer can remove the repetitive content in order to save some of our time."

If the audio quality was not so bad I wouldn't have much issue with the accent. Many of the lessons are clearly cut, so there are no breaks from the speaker and I feel like things are missed between those pieces that are cut. There is a lot of great information that is glazed over and spoken about so quickly that with the accent and bad audio quality, it took several times to even hear what the instructor was saying. In addition, when the a video ends, it automatically begins playing the next video halfway through. Each time, I have to start the video over from the beginning which seems like a technical problem that could easily be resolved to improve this course.
Adding subtitles or resources that are accessible within Udemy would be helpful as well. The course could be excellent but these things mentioned above make the course almost unbearable."

These 6 sections are properly explained. I found Section 7 of no use, nothing was properly explained. Why Flume, HBase is included in a Kafka course I don't know. Many sections are included from other courses of the instructor hence sometime there is no link between previous and current section.
Important concepts of Kafka like Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams, KSQL were missing. Hope these gets included soon. Including these will make the course a great one."

I think the course could be simplified a bit by by listing the main points. There is lot of repetition of code, so highlighting only the differential part would have been sufficient. One thing I liked the about the course which is different than other course is that the instructor teaches you how to resolve problems and understand the help commands. I don't think any course does that. I took another course which was much simpler to first understand the basics. After finishing that course, I started this course to get a deep understanding of the concepts. It is not that this course doesn't teach you basics but it gets overwhelming for a newbie at times. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to get involved with learning big data technologies in greater details."

"Sqoop, Hive and Impala for Data Analysts (Formerly CCA 159)",2019-06-10 17:03:06,5,"It is one of the most comprehensive courses on certification. I have enrolled in a few related courses on Udemy  but by far found this to be the best one. There is some room for improvement. First is that the notes give very little and generic information. I usually watch videos first for the concepts and then practice using the notes. However, in the course, the notes have outlines only. I saw that there is a list of commands after each section which is good. However, it would be better if there is an example below the commands. A better option is still to show examples in notes but if it can't be done there, example in end of the section (under HDFS Resources and exercises) will be very helpful. Also, solutions to the exercises should be provided. Finally, last but not as important , if the instructor can speak little bit slowly. Reducing the speed on Udemy portal makes it too slow. I have only gone through first section. I will update as I progress."

For the last chapters the concept is getting a bit unclear: they have a lot of redundancy from previous chapters but do not contribute that strong (could be shortened by just giving the solution and pointing to previous chapters). The over-all time frame of 32 hours is very long (even if demands for other topics exist, this time frame  to my opinion - should not be extended)."

I have now postponed the exam date by 2 weeks just so I can practise. Other than this, I have not seen any other tests available at all. This type of practise is a must.

In my case, I have lots of software development experience, but no big data experience. So all of this is very new to me, but with Durga's udemy course, I have been able to learn a lot.

This test is golden, and a MUST for people taking the exam! Many thanks to Durga sir and the itversity team for all their help."

Hello Durga sir,

I learned Big Data technologies by following your videos. I have completed your 'CCA 175 - Spark and Hadoop Developer Certification - Scala' in Udemy. I got the confidence to appear for the CCA 175 exam. Thanks a lot for creating excellent content.I was excited to see the your CCA 175 Practice test course, but expected the solutions also. Please share the solutions.It would be a great help for me to take CCA 175 exam. Thanks a lot. I appreciate your great effort.

Durga Viswanatha Raju Gadiraju (Instructor), 3 days ago

I am planning to add one more section with retakes. As part of retakes, I have provided solutions as well. Udemy does not facilitate to retake the assignments and hence you have to go to next section to retake the exams. As part of Solutions we have provided the solution as per our approach along with validation steps. Please check the 2 assignments which are added. I will be adding third one soon.

Thank you Durga Sir,

I'll work on these solutions.
Thanks for considering my concern and adding the solution in the course.
I appreciate you effort and sincerity.

Thanks and regards,
Arivoli"

Good place to start if you want to learn RDDs, DataFrames, Spark SQL, DStreams and useful technologies Sqoop, Hive, Spark, Flume, Kafka, Spark Streaming. It gives me confidence to answer my clients when they talk about these technologies.  Good Job Mr Raju!! Thanks."

Durga, I also took your CCA-175 course using Spark and Scala. I love your courses and your presentation.  In this course, you spoke really fast, and I found myself rewinding quite a bit, and even slowing down to x.75 speed sometimes.  However, the speed at which you speak to does serve well to cover a lot of content in this course, so I am not disappointed by any means.  The resources provided are excellent.  I had to troubleshoot a few issues, but that has nothing to do with your content.  By the way, your CCA-175 course helped me to get a job!  I am taking this course to add to my skills.  Please keep putting out solid, industry-relevant content!"

I have set up my own cluster and did practice. I love instructor effort a lot. This course is not for absolute beginner. He must have some prior knowledge into Big Data world and its eco-system. It will be very useful for them who didn't have practice well.

Please do have this course into your bucket if you want to clear the exam. I have already purchased few courses from him and finished almost all. Got very nice grip.

Build streaming applications using Apache Kafka and Scala,2018-12-07 05:45:07,1,"The experience thus far is pretty terrible.  The video fades in and out of focus, remaining out of focus for more than 70% of the video time.  This makes it difficult as you cannot pause when lengthy commands are being issued and replicate them as the video is out of focus and the command is not legible.  Usually the transcripts are helpful but they are useless in this course.  

Most course have resources available for download (zips of code examples, transcripts, slides, etc) from Udemy.  This course forces you to a third party site (Itversity) which requires an additional login, etc.  The point of this appears to be to showcase other learning they have which is not available from Udemy which seems a bit shady.

The instructor seems knowledgable and the course would probably be fine if the video quality wasn't so awful."

Bought this course on  October. I have a Big Data background and had worked before few years back and currently practicing as a Data Scientist. I   Planned to Learn this to rehash my skills that i left 2.5years back and give a shot  on CCA175 on December Last , 2018. From beginning it was interesting and the way Durga sir had handled this was phenomenal. Instead of spending a planned 1 hour / day on this, i went beyond 2hrs and also purchased a month long itversity lab access for as low as 14.95$ for practicing and stayed well ahead of my planned schedule. And much to my surprise got the confidence towards 70% of course that i could clear the certification. Practiced whatever that is shown and went ahead cleared my CCA175 on December 1st itself (which is 3 weeks ahead) :) Simply Phenomenal stuff from Durga Sir. I had so much hestitation for the course and purchase of itversity labs , but now after my experience i would gladly recommend this to anyone who wants to gain a competitive edge by learning and showcasing skills :) 

Durga Sir you simply Rock!!!!!!!!!! Waiting for your new course on CCP  / CCA data analyst."

I bought 2 of them seeing the topic name but noticed that both of them having same issue. Contacted instructor and he promised with a date that it will be given but now that date crossed good time back and no response. Really upset with this. Not sure how can someone upload an incomplete course and charge to students. Do not fall for this trap.

Fundamentals of Programming using Python 3,2018-11-24 14:14:00,4,I'm half-way through the course. May be as i complete the course i would give a better rating. Overall the course is decent but it lacks some-real world applications & exercises. I did the Apache Sqoop certification course from the same instructor. The explanation & examples were a little better. Also the video quality can be improved & the speed of speaking can be slowed down a little. Overall good course with room for improvements.

HDPCD:Spark using Python (pyspark),2018-10-28 00:20:48,2.5,"First - A good attempt by instructor and his team to cover the certification material in one Course.
Reasons for two and half star rating:
1. Instructor's lack of preparation is very evident. There are so many errors during execution of example and for few examples the results are complete wrong. e.g. accumulator section.
2. Starting sections only promotes itversity lab. There are other courses on Udemy where instructors provided introduction on how to connect to cluster etc. just one time at the beginning and after that it is all business. In this course almost till end of section 3 we have to hear about lab and how to connect. I completed the entire course of Hortonworks Sandbox without any issue. So no need to purchase access to labs.
3. Other courses on Udemy provides lifetime access to live cluster with purchase of course. This course provides 1 month access. I did not request one because Sandbox is good for course.
4. Extremely unprofessional presentation. There are notifications popping in between videos, phone ringing, low battery messages. Just horrible presentation.

Now let's discuss some good points of this course:
1. Since instructor made numerous errors while running code, it was irritating in beginning to see errors but then it was a good learning experience because if you pause the video and analyze them you learn more.
2. You get access to sample data and a scenario to code against. Can be easily found online but it was a good learning experience to go through scenario and practice exam objectives.
3. Instructor referred to spark documentation continuously which was great because eventually you also start referring to documentation and then during certification you know exactly the place to refer to in case there is some issue."

Looking forward to upgrade course content targeting HDPCD Spark 2.X rather than Spark 1.6 (Outdated)

Background noise during recordings; Improvement required on instructor communication and organizing the delivery and cut-short the length of session in effective way to keep the enthusiasm..

Please extend the 5 examples being covered by also elaborating with the details Spark UI Job execution details (by explaining the details of stages,tasks,executors etc after each exercise) to understand job execution clearly..It would help the job understand resource optimization even more better..

Free HDP Sandbox cluster available on cloud from Azure and Amazon  (with free subscription for 1 Month or 1 Year)..It could have been better if the exercises are demonstrated using either of those rather than your own itversity.com cluster.."

HDPCD:Spark using Scala,2018-10-18 23:20:51,4,"I took this course to learn Spark Core and SQL and to prepare for the HDPCD exam format. This course has helped me achieve these goals by focusing on hands-on exercises step by step. However, I recommend the student learn separately Scala and Hive before taking this course. I also I struggled to understand the instructor's accent. I think summary slides would have helped at the end of lessons. But overall, I learned most of what I needed."

Hats off to Durga, he explained it so well and in-depth for the certification. now I am capable to write Spark code by my own.

Thank You!"

  - It lacks a proper introduction to Hadoop and Big Data.
  - It's very hard to understand the instructor's accent, and there are no transcripts. On top of that, the sound is bad and there are background noises sometimes.
  - The classes lack previous preparation. The explanations are unclear, and sometimes even repeated throughout the video. There are classes where the instructor is trying to show a command, and it doesn't work, and we're just sitting there waiting for 3 seconds of complete silence, while he thinks what went wrong.

Definitely not worth the money."

The thing is this course need subtitles to make a better understanding of the student, English is an international language but accent sometimes can trick and make simple explanation a bit painful.

Considering all I have done in the course, I just have good critics about, but please subtitles would make this course even better."

(Update after course completion: The 5 star still remains. Some of the stammering and code bugs could have been avoided if Durga could have created the codes earlier rather than writing them in the fly, and those times could have been utilized in providing more examples.
Also, there are some difficult areas where a pause and a re-explanation was needed. The time could have been utilized there. But, overall, a very good course by an experienced person who have walked the talk."

I would say , it's one of the best courses on Udemy, which guide us for the certification. 

ITVersity is good learning platform & help to learn big data techologies.
I have cleared HDPCD: Java & HDPCD: No Java Certification using knowledge shared by Durga Sir & 
now preparing for HDPCD: Spark using this course"
Spark SQL and PySpark 3 using Python 3 Hands-On with Labs,2018-06-14 18:07:40,4.5,"PROS:
The course covers every part in detail and I would recommend this to everyone who is targetting to get Spark Hadoop certification.

CONS:
1. The only thing the bothers me is to buy the setup from Itversity, as part of this course it is provided for one month but after one month I have to buy the lab setup which cost me almost $15. So, in total this course cost me $65.00 which bothers me being a student with no source of income whatsoever.
2. There are many videos which have a repeated information, which might be necessary at times but not always.
3. For discussions, we are asked to post the queries to discuss.iteversity.com which I think is not required Udemy has already this thing covered, where you can ask questions lecture wise which is far more doable then log in to discuss.itversity.com and post the question."

Spark SQL and Spark 3 using Scala Hands-On with Labs,2018-04-16 00:49:21,5,"I waited until I finished the course to write this review.  You cannot properly evaluate a course after one or two lessons.  I think Udemy does this, because most people won't finish the course anyway, so they ask for reviews early in the course.  Anyway, this course is exactly what I needed. Durga, the instructor is experienced and gives in-depth explanations, and supporting information about coding, and frameworks, etc.  I took the CCA-175 before taking this course, about 2 months ago, and I did not pass. This course really clarified some things for me, like solving business cases using core Spark and Scala APIs vs. SQL and Data-frames.  I especially like Durga's course over others, because he actually shows you how to write the code in real-time, on-screen, and even makes mistakes, then corrects them.  Other courses simply move at light-speed through the material, using code they have already pre-written and debugged, and also without giving proper explanation and context.  Fortunately, Durga doesn't do this... This course is almost like being in a real classroom.  I am also an instructor, and have delivered technical classroom training on subjects like Linux and Solaris to fortune 500 companies around the country.  That being said, I appreciate the way Durga takes his time and clearly explains each topic, as well as telling you and showing you where to find additional information and resources.  I have attended real classroom training before taking this course, and sadly I learned more from Durga. I also bought two other Big Data courses on Udemy. One was good, but not as good as Durga's, and the other just plain bombed!  If you want to really learn how to code Hadoop, and Spark applications in Scala, especially how to write applications in Spark/Scala - get this course! It's the best one on Udemy!  You won't be sorry!  FYI: I also took an additional Scala Fundamentals course, and an SQL course while taking this one. I plan to sit for the CCA-175 again by the end of this month.  I hope this helps someone."

The course might have good material but the strong native accent influence and delivery make it very hard to go through a large part of a course in a single take. There are a lot of stutters and if me being an Indian have problems with these, I am not sure how non-Indians would like the communication here. One friendly suggestion would be to team up with someone for course delivery it will really help make a global impact for the course. 

The only thing I liked here is the presence of data sets and the great ITversity labs.

Thanks"

How this course is different from others - I feel Durga is hitting on points which are directly applicable in real time projects plus exactly what you need for certification. He is more into practical rather than theory and that is what I was looking for. 

So far I am loving this course... the only reason I gave 4 star is ..I feel it could be better if there are some live interaction sessions with instructor in timely manner to discuss doubts."

The best part , I get all my doubts cleared by posting the questions . What else can we expect . There is no doubt about Durga Sir's skills in the field of Big data . 

One thing I would like to suggest , it would be more helpful for people like me if you can put some more details on how the applications are developed in the real projects . You can even create a new tutorial which explains everything that is involved in a real time project by taking a mini project and explain all the aspects. 

Thanks a lot all your great work and helping people who are enthusiastic about learning Big data related technologies ."
